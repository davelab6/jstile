<h2>About the demo (Firefox only)</h2>

This demo gives you another idea of <b>Observer Pattern</b>. Traditionally
Observer Pattern is used in various places in GUI framework like
MVC. The idea here is to use a <b>Generator</b> to represent a dependency
instead of keeping dependents list manually. For example:

<pre>
// Basic example of an infinite loop as an observer (like eToys).
function everything() {
  yield; // Just an idiom because the first yield can not receive a value.
  while (true) {
    $("everything").innerHTML = yield; // Get updated X value (now it's hard-coded)
  };
}
Model.addDependent(everything());
</pre>

In this demo. The Model keeps track current mouse X position. And
"everything" handler just follow the value. In this case, the handler
is just a infinite loop. But the process reaches the point of "yield",
it is blocked and wait next changed value. Basically this behavior is
same as UNIX's pipe. Or, you can see this is same as eToys process.

<pre>
// It lives only 100 cycle, after that, the dependency is released automatically.
function first100() {
  yield;
  for(var i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    $("first100").innerHTML = yield;
  }; 
}
Model.addDependent(first100());
</pre>

This is more interesting one. "first100" handler only handles first
100 updates in the model. It is represented by FOR loop naturally. But
if you write this behavior with Observer Pattern, you have to keep a
counter somewhere, and after it finish, you need to remove it from
dependents list by yourself.

<pre>
// Only one of 100 is interesting. (because sleep() is difficult in JS)
function each100() {
  yield;
  while (true) {
    for (var i = 0; i < 99; i++) yield; // Throw away 99 times!
    $("each100").innerHTML = yield;
  }
}
Model.addDependent(each100());
</pre>
Last example is useful if you don't want every updates.

<h2>Motivation and Goal</h2>

<p>
Both <b>Observer Pattern</b> (MVC) and <b>Polling</b> (Morphic) have
each advantage and drawback. If frequency of model's update is slow
(like keyboard input), or the timing is critical, Observer Pattern is
efficient choice. But if it is very high (like system clock) or there
are numbers of observer (like eToys' viewer), Polling is better. And
Polling is easier to understand. One motivation is to unify those
ideas. The behavior of this demo is same as Observer Pattern, but it
can be described like Polling (NOTE: This demo doesn't do anything
like a pooling, but I think there is a way to mix those behavior).
</p>

<p>
Another motivation is to provide a universal event model
everywhere. If a program should be a set of independent processes
talking each other like Internet. Object dependency should be described
same manner. In this demo, you can see each observer as an event
handler.
